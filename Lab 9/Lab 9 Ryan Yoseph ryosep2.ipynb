    "In this section we want to simulate the ML (maximum likelihood) rule for independent observations.  For simplicity, we consider two hyptheses for a sequence of $N$ independent discrete random variables, with values in {0, . . . , n-1}.  Let $p_0$ and $p_1$ be two probability vectors of length $n$, representing two probability distributions over the set of possible values {0,1, . . . ,n-1}.  Under hypothesis $H_1$ the observations are independent with pmf $p_1$ and under $H_0$ the observations are independent with pmf $p_0.$  The given code is for $p_0=[0.2,0.2,0.4,0.2]$ and $p_1=[0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your ECE 313 class, you have used the likelihood ratio test (LRT) implementation of the ML rule to determine which hypothesis is most likely. Recall that the liklihood ratio for each observation $k$ is defined by: $$\\Lambda(k) = \\frac{p_1(k)}{p_0(k)}$$   For a single observaton $k$, under the ML rule, we declare Hypothesis 1 if $\\Lambda(k)>1$ and declare Hypothesis 0 if $\\Lambda(k)<1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we want to be able to declare a hypothesis based on multiple observations. We can still use the LRT to determine which hypothesis to declare. This requires simply multiplying the likelihood ratios for the individual observations, to yield the likelihood ratio for all of the observations:\n",
    "$$\\Lambda(k_0,k_1,...k_{N-1})=\\frac{p_1(k_0)}{p_0(k_0)}*\\frac{p_1(k_1)}{p_0(k_1)}*...\\frac{p_1(k_{N-1})}{p_0(k_{N-1})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below creates two distributions (one for each hypothesis). It randomly chooses a hypothesis to be true and generates N random variates from that distribution. Finally, it computes $\\Lambda$ and compares it to the threshold  one to declare (i.e. detect) a hypothesis.  Afterwards it evaluates whether an error, either a false alarm or miss, occurred.  Run the code a few times to see different outcomes."

    "1. When $N=1$, there is only one value for $variates$ and therefore only one folding process our reduce function needs to takes place (maybe technically there is no folding. What I mean when I say \"one folding\" is that only one ratio is taken and not multiple). Given that we set the true hypothesis to either $H_0\\ or\\ H_1$, we must find the probability that $Lamb>=1$ or $Lamb<1$. For false alarm, $Lamb>=1$ occurs 40% of the time because there is a 40% chance we choose the first two entries in the p0 matrix that make the ratio >1. For miss, $Lamb<1$ occurs 30% of the time because there is a 30% chance that we choose the last two values in the p1 matrix that make the ratio < 1. Therefore, $p_{false\\ alarm}$ occurs with 40% probability and $p_{miss}$ occurs with 30% probability.\n",

    "5. Yes, by increasing $N$ we see a very sharp decline in the number of false alarm and miss cases. This is the case because when Htrue == 1, there is a 30% chance that we half the folding ratio (for this case, we want Lamb<1 so we are interested in the probabiltiy that we half the folding ratio). When Htrue == 0, there is a 40% chance that we 2x or 1.5x the folding ratio (for this case, we want Lamb>=1 so we are interested in the probability that we can get the folding ratio to finish >=1). Because both of the desired probabilities are <.5 and due to the pattern of multiplying values of [0.5,0.5,1.5,2], this is why we observe very different probabilities as we increase $N$. Furthermore, what I explained here can be visualized by running the next cell several times."

    "If we take a look at the values of the likelihood ratio produced by the simulations above for $N>1$, we see that sometimes the value is much larger than one or much smaller than one.  This suggests that even if we used fewer than all N observations we would have made the correct decision.   Other times the value of the likelihood ratio is close to one, suggesting it would be useful to take some additional observations.    The  idea of *sequential hypothesis testing* (originally developed by A. Wald in the 1940's--see his 1945 paper <A href=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2235829> \"Sequential tests of statistical hypotheses\"</A>) is to try to reduce the average number of observations required for the same error probabilities by using a variable number of observations.   Specifically, Wald's *sequential probability ratio test* (SPRT) works as follows. After each observation we compare the likelihood ratio obtained so far to two thresholds, A and B, where  0 < B < 1 < A.  If the likelihood ratio is smaller than B we stop taking samples and declare $H_0$ to be true.   If the likelihood ratio is larger than A we stop taking samples and declare $H_1$ to be true.   If the likelihood ratio is between the thresholds we take another observation. Below is an example of sequential hypothesis testing for the two hypotheses we had in the previous problem."

    "Clearly, the probabilities of a false alarm or miss are dependent upon the values chosen for A and B. It can be shown that for given values $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ between zero and one, we can ensure that $p_{false alarm}\\leq\\alpha$ and $p_{miss}\\leq \\beta$ by setting $A = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ and $B =\\beta.$  This choice is on the conservative side.  Less conservative approximations for suitable thresholds (see p. 131 of Wald's paper) are given by $A = \\frac{1-\\beta}{\\alpha}$ and $B =\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\alpha}.$\n",

    "When implementing likelihood ratios for large numbers of observations, the likelihood ratios can get extremely small (close to zero) or large.  An equivalent implementation that is numerically more stable\n",
    "is to work with the logarithms of the likelihood ratios.   Instead of multiplying likelihood ratios as we did above, we can add log likelihood ratios using the update rule $S_i = S_{i-1}+\\log(\\Lambda_i).$  If we stop taking observations when $S_i<\\log(B)$ or $S_i>\\log(A)$ the test is equivalent to the one without taking logs and using thresholds B and A.\n",

For the numerical values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in parts 1 and 2 below, use the probabilities $p_{false~alarm}$ and $p_{miss}$, respectively, that you obtained experimentally in the last part of Problem 1.  That way, you should obtain a sequential testing rule with error probabilities of each type smaller than those for the nonsquential method in Problem 1.\n",

    "3. When we compare how many observations are necessary to declare a hypothesis, using sequential hypothesis testing reduces the number of observations needed by about 10 (an average of 15 steps for the conservative threshold and 14.82 steps for the less conservative threshold). There is pretty much no difference between number of observations needed when using the conservative versus less conservative thresholds because the threshold values are similar to one another regardless. When you look at Problem 1, it takes 25 steps to arrive at a solution due to 25 independent ratios being multiplied by each other. Therefore, Wald is correct when he notes that using sequential hypothesis testing reduces the number of observations needed by setting threshold values for $H_1$ and $H_2$"

    "A very popular problem in random walks is known as the gambler's ruin problem. You should recognize this as a more simplified version of that zombie simulation we did back in Lab 6. Suppose that you're a gambler and you have $k$ units of money. You think you're a pretty good gambler and tell yourself you will leave the casino as soon as you have accumulated a total of $b$ units money, for some $b$ with $b>k$.\n",
    "However, if you run out of money you need to stop playing; we say you are ruined in that case.  You can place only one bet for one unit of money at a time and the outcomes of the bet's are independent of each other. With each bet you have a probability $p$ of increasing your total by one and a probability $1-p$ of decreasing your total by one.  You could do this, for example, by betting one unit of money on red at a\n",

    "\n",
    "To answer the question of probability requires a recurrence equation and we'll get to that in a little bit, but first let's just simulate this problem. It is essentially a random walk. We can create a discrete random variable object to store the distribution used for the outcome of each bet, and use random variates of the object to model the independent outcomes.  We stop our simulation when we've either lost all our money or reached our goal."

    "Explore the gambler's ruin simulator if you want. For the given numbers ($p=18/38,b=20,$ initial stake 15) do you think the chance of success is greater than 50%?  Change the probabilities or the monetary values. What would you expect to happen if we had $p=\\frac{1}{2}$? As stated before, in order to determine the probability of ruin, we need to set up a recurrence equation. Remember that the outcome for each bet placed is independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $r_k$ represent the probability of ruin when we start with k units of money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the bets are independent we should see, by the law of total probability based on the outcome of the first bet, that $r_k=p*r_{k+1}+(1-p)*r_{k-1}.$   That is, the probability that we're ruined starting with $k$ units of money is equal to $p$ times the probability we're ruined starting with $k+1$ units of money plus $1-p$ times the probability we're ruined starting with $k-1$ units of money.  The boundary conditions are $r_0=1$ and $r_b=0,$ becasue if we have no money the probability we're ruined is 1, if we're at our goal, the probability we're ruined is 0). So we have $b-1$ equations for $b-1$ unknowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have seen such a set of linear equations in one of your math classes, but this recurrence has a closed form solution: $r_k=C_1\\lambda_1^k+C_2\\lambda_2^k$, where $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$ solve the characteristic equation $\\lambda=p\\lambda^2+(1-p)$ which is derived from our recurrence equation. (A quick way to derive this characteristic equation from the recurrence equation is to replace $r_k$ with $\\lambda^k$, $r_{k+1}$ with $\\lambda^{k+1}$ and $r_{k-1}$ with $\\lambda^{k-1}$, then cancel out $\\lambda^{k-1}$ on both sides). To solve for the two constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, we use the two boundary conditions $r_0=1, r_b=0.$  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example let's use the initial conditions set up above where $b=20,k=15,p=\\frac{18}{38}$. The first step is to find $\\lambda$ from the recurrence equation: $0=p\\lambda^2-\\lambda+(1-p)$"

    "<br>**<SPAN style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #C0C0C0\">Problem 4:</SPAN>** Now, I want you to analyze a slightly more complext version of the gambler's ruin problem. Suppose that a gambler walks into a casino with 15 units of money and will leave if he meets his goal of 20 units of money or if he loses all of his money. For each bet, there is a probability of 0.4 that he wins one unit of money, a probability 0.15 that he breaks even (neither wins nor loses money), and a probability 0.45 that he loses one unit of money. \n",
